CRITICAL WARNING: [Common 17-69] Command failed: Cannot set load on pre-synthesized design.  Please open a synthesized design (or synthesize the current design) and rerun this command. [F:/Xilinx/Vivado_code/Question_1/Fuction_1/Fuction_1.srcs/constrs_1/new/Fuction1.xdc:4]

INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [F:/Xilinx/Vivado_code/Question_1/Fuction_1/Fuction_1.srcs/constrs_1/new/Fuction1.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/Fuction1_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/Fuction1_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
